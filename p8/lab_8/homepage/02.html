         <p class="p1">CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 and later developed by Lie and Bert Bos. CSS was introduced to address the limitations of HTML in terms of design and layout control.</p>

        <h2>The history of CSS can be divided into three major versions :</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            1. CSS1: This was the first official version of CSS, released in 1996. It provided basic styling capabilities like font properties, colors, margins, and padding. However, it had limited support from web browsers at that time.
              <br><br>
            2. CSS2: Released in 1998, CSS2 expanded on the capabilities of CSS1 by introducing new features such as positioning elements on a page, adding background images, and supporting media-specific stylesheets. It also introduced pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements for more precise targeting of elements.
              <br><br>
            3. CSS3: The latest major version of CSS is CSS3, which is still under development but has been widely adopted by modern web browsers. It introduces numerous new features and enhancements to improve design flexibility and interactivity.

        <h2>Some notable attributes introduced in CSS3 include :</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            - Border-radius: This attribute allows you to create rounded corners on elements such as divs or buttons.
            <br><br>
            - Box-shadow: With this attribute, you can add shadows to elements, giving them depth and dimension.
            <br><br>
            - Transition: This attribute enables smooth transitions between different states of an element (e.g., changing color or size).
            <br><br>
            - Animation: With the animation attribute, you can create complex animations by defining keyframes and specifying their timing.
            <br><br>
            - Flexbox: Flexbox is a layout model that provides flexible ways to distribute space among items within a container. It simplifies responsive design and helps achieve complex layouts with ease.
            <br><br>
            - Grid: The grid attribute allows for the creation of two-dimensional layouts, providing precise control over the placement and alignment of elements.

        These are just a few examples of the many attributes introduced in CSS3. CSS continues to evolve, with new features being proposed and implemented to enhance web design capabilities.
