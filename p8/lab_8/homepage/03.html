        <p class="p1">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level programming language that was first introduced in 1995. It was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation (now Mozilla Corporation), with the initial purpose of adding interactivity to websites.</p>

        <h2>Here is a brief timeline of the history of JavaScript :</h2>
        <p class="p1">
<br>
1. Creation: In 1995, Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in just 10 days while working at Netscape. Originally named "Mocha," it was later renamed to "LiveScript" and finally settled on "JavaScript" due to the popularity of Java at that time.
<br><br>
2. Standardization: Recognizing the potential of JavaScript beyond just Netscape's browser, Netscape submitted it to Ecma International for standardization. The first edition of the ECMAScript standard (ECMAScript 1) was released in June 1997.
<br><br>
3. Growth and Adoption: As web browsers started supporting JavaScript, its popularity grew rapidly. Developers began using it to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br><br>
4. DOM Manipulation: In 1998, the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 specification was released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This allowed developers to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript, enabling more advanced web applications.
<br><br>
5. ECMAScript Versions: Over the years, several versions of ECMAScript have been released with new features and improvements. Notable versions include ECMAScript 3 (released in 1999), ECMAScript 5 (released in 2009), ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES2015, released in 2015), and the latest version as of now, ECMAScript 2022.
<br><br>
6. Frameworks and Libraries: With the growth of JavaScript's popularity, numerous frameworks and libraries were developed to simplify web development. Examples include jQuery, React.js, AngularJS, Vue.js, and Node.js.
<br><br>
7. Server-Side JavaScript: Initially, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting. However, with the introduction of Node.js in 2009, JavaScript could also be used for server-side development. This allowed developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both client and server-side programming.
<br><br>
8. Modern Web Applications: Today, JavaScript is an essential part of modern web development. It is used to create interactive web applications, mobile apps (using frameworks like React Native), desktop applications (using frameworks like Electron), and even serverless functions (using platforms like AWS Lambda).

        <h2>Example :</h2>
            <p class="p1"><br>
                        Here's a simple example of JavaScript code that displays a "Hello, World!" message in a web browser :
            <br><br>
            javascript<br>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
            &lt;html&gt;<br>
            &lt;head&gt;<br>
            &lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;<br>
            &lt;/head&gt;<br>
            &lt;body&gt;<br><br>

            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            // JavaScript code<br>
            document.write("Hello, World!");<br>
            &lt;/script&gt;<br><br>

            &lt;/body&gt;<br>
            &lt;/html&gt;
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                This code snippet demonstrates how JavaScript can be embedded within an HTML document to provide dynamic content. When the page is loaded in a browser, the message "Hello, World!" will be displayed on the screen.
           <br><br>
            Note: In modern web development practices, it is recommended to separate JavaScript code into external files and link them using script tags rather than embedding them directly within HTML documents.
