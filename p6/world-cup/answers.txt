Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 100 is not good and it is wrong

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: simulations 1000000 is enough and good for this
